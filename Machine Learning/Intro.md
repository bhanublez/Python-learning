## Machine Learning Fundamentals

>Firstly ML is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience and by use of data sets. They are based on the "training data", in order to predictions or decisions without being explicit;y programed to do so.

Tom M. Mitchell ML technical definition:

> *A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.*

### AI, Data Science, ML and Deep Learning

AI is a branch of computer science the deal with the building intelligent machine which  is capable of performing tasks at the level of human. Simple term it mimic human. This involves ML, data science, programming, robotics etc...

ML already discussed.

Deep Learning is branch ML that deal with study of Artificial neural networks and it is inspired by the human brain.


Data Science is use to solve business problem using data with various techniques. Simple term it is the science of making data useful.

### Applications of ML

    1. Fraud Detection
    2. Diagnosing diseases and predicting the survival rate
    3. Speech/ Face/ and Pattern Detection
    4. Churn prediction
    5. Spam Detection
    6. Autonomous vehicles

### Types of ML Systems
    
    1. Supervised Learning
    2. Unsupervised Learning
    3. Semi-supervised learning
    4. Self-supervised learning
    5. Reinforcement learning

### Types of Problems

* **Classification Problem** where the task is to identify a given category from numerous categories or simply make choice between a number of categories.

* **Regression Problem** where the goal is to predict a continuous value of something.

### The Typical Machine Learning Workflow

* Defining and formulating a problem
* Collecting data
* Establishing a baseline
* Exploratory data analysis(EDA)
* Preparing data
* Selecting and training a model
* Performing error analysis and improving a model
* Evaluating a model
* Deploying a model

## A confusion matrix

* **True Positives(TP)**:

* **False Positives (FP)**:

* **True Negatives (TN)**:

* **False Negatives (FN)**:


*Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)*

*Precision = TP / (TP + FP)*


*Recall = TP / (TP+FN)*


*F1 Score = 2 x(precision x recall) / (precision + recall)*
