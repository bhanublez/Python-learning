# *What is Pattern Recognition?*

Pattern recognition is the process of identifying and interpreting the patterns, structure and regularities in data set. It is a subfield of machine learning and  Artificial Intelligence. In simple term is automate the process of classification and clustering. 

Real time Example in daily life: In our daily life we use pattern recognition in many ways. For example, we use pattern recognition in face and voice recognition, also finger recognition in mobile phones. Which is drastically changed improving the security of mobile phones and enhancing the user experience.

## *Application of Pattern Recognition?*

1. Speech Recognition: Speech recognition is the process of converting spoken words to text, and it is one of the most complex pattern recognition problems. It is used widely in voice assistants like Alexa, Siri, Google Assistant, etc.

2. Image Recognition: Image recognition is the process of identifying and detecting an object or a feature in a digital image or video. It is used in self-driving cars, face recognition, etc.

3. Medical Diagnosis: Medical diagnosis is the process of identifying a disease by its signs and symptoms. It is used in the diagnosis of diseases like cancer, diabetes, etc.

4. Handwriting Recognition: Handwriting recognition is the process of converting handwritten text to digital text. It is used in converting handwritten documents to digital documents.

5. Fraud Detection: Fraud detection is the process of identifying fraudulent transactions. It is used in credit card fraud detection, insurance fraud detection, etc.

## What is classification and clustering?

Both classification and clustering are used for pattern recognition.

Where classification is a supervised learning approach. It involves training a model using a set of predefined labeled data. The model is trained using the labeled data and then used to predict the class of the new data.

Where clustering is an unsupervised learning approach. It involves grouping the data into clusters based on their similarities. The data points in the same cluster are similar to each other, and the data points in different clusters are dissimilar to each other.

In simple tern classification is a process of sorting of objects according to the there characteristic, where clustering is refer as grouping of similar objects in which data set does not have any predefined labels.

## ***Key difference between classification and clustering***

1. Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning: Classification is a supervised learning approach, whereas clustering is an unsupervised learning approach.

2. Training Data: Classification involves training a model using a set of predefined labeled data. Clustering involves grouping the data into clusters based on their similarities.

3. Goal: The goal of classification is to sorting of objects according to the there characteristic. The goal of clustering is to group the data into clusters based on their similarities.

4. Output: The output of classification is a class label. The output of clustering is a cluster label.

5. Types: Classification is of two types: binary classification and multi-class classification. Clustering is of two types: hard clustering and soft clustering.

6. Algorithms: Classification algorithms include logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, etc. Clustering algorithms include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, etc.
